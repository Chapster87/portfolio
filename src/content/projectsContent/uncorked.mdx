  <p>Uncorked.com serves as the commerce platform for the <a class="link link-primary" href="https://terlato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Terlato Wine Group</a>. Working very close with Saleforce themselves, Terlato's plan was to leverage 3 different Salesforce Suites at site launch: Marketing Cloud, Salesforce CMS, and Salesforce Commerce Cloud. Making it one of the first full Salesforce solution projects to be launched.</p>
  <p>Such a high-profile job meant we wanted to put our best foot forward. Collaborating during project discovery with both DEG Design and UX departments, we architected a site that was user-friendly, easy to navigate, and fit within the SFCC parameters. The innovative site design made for a considerable amount of platform customization, breaking the mold of OOTB SFRA templates and allowing for content creativity.</p>
  <p>One of Terlato's main goals was to appeal to all wine drinkers from the casual drinker, to the collector. This involved both educating visitors, as well as providing the utmost information about all facets of the wine industry. Our team was responsible for creating landing page templates that would allow customers to browse by wine style, winery, vintage, or appellation, while also reading about the significance of each. All wine product pages provided certified ratings, and integral information like aging, style, flavor, aroma, taste profiles.</p>
  <p>One of the most significant challenges was the integration of Salesforce CMS. CMS would be integrated into both the Terlato.com website and SFCC side of things, with the idea being that content could be created in one place and then pulled into each site as needed to build out content pages.</p>
  <p>CMS's connection point into SFRA was through Page Designer. We were responsible for developing CMS-enabled components that connected to the CMS data stream, allowing merchandisers to select data nodes and generate content. This required a data-mapping to connect CMS data-points to Page Designer fields ensuring data was displayed correctly. Alongside side the CMS-enabled components, I also created non-CMS versions of all components that allowed on-the-fly content creation. This allowed the merchandising team the ability to create SFCC specific content as needed.</p>
