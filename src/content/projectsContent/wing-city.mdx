short_desc: 'This project was one of my first experiences with WordPress. I designed and developed a custom WordPress theme to fit the client’s needs. Being the food business, the client needed a solution that could grow as the restaurant did. I chose WordPress because I felt it presented the desired balance of customization from a developer perspective while still allowing ease for the client to add and edit content. This allowed the client to edit the menu and also update his dynamic “Events” and “Specials” pages.'
