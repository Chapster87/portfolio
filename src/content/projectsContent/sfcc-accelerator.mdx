short_desc: The Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) Accelerator is our solution to the repetitive task of fixing the same bugs, or building the same customizations on every project, when starting from Salesforce's Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA). Instead, using a custom, optimized codebase as our jumping off point to save time and effort.

  <p>The Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) "Accelerator" was a concept born from the repetitive task of fixing the exact same bugs, or building the exact same customizations on every project, when starting from Salesforce's Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA). Our answer was to introduce a codebase ("cartridge") that could be used as a jumping off point for all projects. It would save us time, effort, and offer us the opportunity to develop complex enhancements that could be maintained project to project.</p>
  <p>SFCCuses a "cartridge" approach in their platform architecture. These "cartridges" allow extension of the platform through the layering of code versions that will maintain a hierarchy of "top most" files (aka "left most" in "cartridge path") being honored as the final rendered version. Using this method, the idea was maintain a "middle" cartridge that sat between the base SFRA cartridge, and the client cartridge. Meaning that we could overwrite SFRA base files with changes from our "Accelerator" cartridge, which could then be overwritten by the client cartridge during the site implementation.</p>
  <p>Our intention with a "middle" cartridge approach was that if we made updates or developed a new feature outside of a project that it could easily be merged into any clients environment. In this way we could maintain product updates between clients. Similarly, as SFRA rolled out product updates, we could easily update our "Accelerator" cartridge as well. While our intentions were sound, the truth was that very rarely did any of our customers update their version of SFRA or the "Accelerator" and instead individual enhancements were made as needed. With this being the case, we evolved the "Accelerator" architecture to instead to act as the starting place for the "client" cartridge layered directly onto the SFRA core cartridge. This approach allows all the same bug fixes and enhancements to be maintained, but simplifies the implementation process and allows for easy education of diverse project teams.</p>
  <p>Most of the enhancements that we made to the "Accelerator" were based on the needs of the client. We would develop a feature for one client, and then roll it into the "Accelerator" for future use. By far, though, the most robust enhancement came with the suite of Page Design custom components and the refactor of template architecture. Page Designer is Salesforce's CMS solution for clients wanted to be able to develop their own content pages within the SFCC environment, but the base offering leaves a lot to be desired. It's components are basic, and the template architecture is done in a way that encourages code redundancy. This provided us a key area for enhancements.</p>
  <p>Out-of-the-box, Page Designer allows for the ability create Product Listing (Grid) pages that integrate custom content areas as desired. However, they handle it in a way that uses one copy of template code for the Page Designer version, and a second copy that renders the normal non-Page Designer version. Any core customizations to the Product Listing Page would need to be made on both versions, as well as any other Page Designer duplicated templates within (i.e Product Tiles). To remove this code parity, we unified all Page Designer templates with their no-PD counterparts using a single template, while allowing different data-streams to be utilized within. This optimization alongside the vast collection of custom Page Types, Layouts, and Components developed, made our Accelerator all the more valuable to customers wanting to get the most out of Page Designer at site launch.</p>
  <p>The "Accelerator" has been the starting point for all of my most complex implementations. It has been a key differentiator for our team, and has allowed me to develop a reputation for being able to deliver complex customizations quickly and efficiently.</p>
