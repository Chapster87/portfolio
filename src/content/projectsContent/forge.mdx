<div class="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-full">
  <p>Back in 2018, my rugby club was founded. Using my graphic design background, I took on the task of defining the clubs brand. I designed the club's crest, handled all of the marketing, and of course developed the club website. I chose to launch the site on Wordpress so that the site could easily be handled by committee within the CMS, while at the same time offer me a ton of customization options. The club utilizes the site to handle selling tickets for fundraiser events, tournament sign-ups, and collect player dues. The basis of the commerce is handled by WooCommerce, but the complex front-end, needing to gather information form customers, as well as choose from "product" variation models, is heavily customized. The club's site is a bit of a passion project that I love the challenge of keeping up.</p>
