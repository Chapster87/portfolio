<div class="prose max-w-full">
  <p>First project as Frontend Lead.</p>
  <p>Team handled full implementation of client defined styleguide, and frontend needs.</p>
  <p>Able to modify the SFRA platform heavily to satisfy the needs of a donation only website. This included a one-page checkout experience, as well as the removal of the shipping step of the checkout flow. Step removal was done in a way that client would add back in easily should they move away from digital only "products" and want to ship rewards associated with donations.</p>
