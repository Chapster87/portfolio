<div class="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-full">
  <p>I have been studying React in my free time over the last 2 years. Recently, for fun, I decided to use React Expo, the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TMDB.org</a> API to build a Netflix style media site. The API includes Movie and Show data arranged into various "categories", as well as tons of imagery. It was the perfect source for me to jump into the thick of it with React and get acquainted. I chose to use React Expo because I liked the concept of being able to export IOS and Android app versions of the site down the line should I choose to.</p>
