<div class="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-full">
  <p>I have been studying React in my free time over the last 2 years. Recently, to broaden my understanding, I decided to use React Expo, the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TMDB.org</a> API to build a Netflix style media site. The API includes Movie and Show data arranged into various "categories", as well as tons of imagery. It was the perfect source for me to jump into the thick of it with React and get acquainted. I chose to use React Expo because I liked the concept of being able to export IOS and Android app versions of the site down the line should I choose to. It also uses Supabase for Authentication & Database. This allows "Watched" and "Favorite" statuses to be set, and saved in the database logged to the account.</p>
  <p>Please keep in mind this is very much a sandbox project for me. I try not to push up broken code, but it happens. I am currently toying with rebuilding it in a different framework, despite the progress made. React Expo is cumbersome, and held back by React Native restraints. I can't help but think i could rebuild it faster in something more modern.</p>
