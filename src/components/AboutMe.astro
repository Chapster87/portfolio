    <p>Hi, I'm Andy! I live with my wife, Hannah, and my two giant dogs, Mance & Beorn, in the city of champions - Pittsburgh, PA. While I can nerd it up with the best of them<sup>1</sup>, I find plenty of time away from the computer. I've been an athlete all my life. Since 2009, I have been spending my Saturdays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywq7FNH0Bwc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">bashing heads</a> (including my own) playing competitive rugby. Recently, I have been spending time with a clipboard in my hand, embracing the coaching side of things for my rugby club, the <a href="https://www.pghrugby.com" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club</a><sup>2</sup>. It's been a great experience, and a natural transition as my playing days dwindle. Despite my aging body's protests, I still try to put the boots on every weekend and compete with teams all over the midwest.</p>
    <p>Like the robot above said, I'm a Front-End Engineer that's been working in the web industry for 15 years (11.5 of which were technically the same "job", two acquisitions later). It's cliche, but I'm a firm believer in the saying, "if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life". Coding, to me, is a hobby (that I'm lucky enough to get paid for). Some people like to read; I like to click-clack away on the keys. Every component, page, or new syntax is a puzzle waiting to be solved.</p>
    <p>I have been working with Salesforce Commerce Cloud since 2013, back when it was still Demandware. I know Controllers (remember pipelines?), ISML, and the Business Manager like the back of my hand. I have spent 100s of hours buried in Page Designer, optimizing, customizing and architecting a full suite of custom components and templates. Despite being a "front-end engineer" there is very little in the SFCC world I have not spent time working with, and comfortably consider myself full-stack.</p>
    <p>Though SFCC has been the main focus of my career, I'm very open to exploring other web technologies and commerce platforms. Last year, I received my Shopify Liquid Storefronts for Theme Developers cert just as a way of familiarizing myself with the platform. I built a <a href="/project/prometheus">TMDB.org API Media Site</a>, and the website of the <a href="/project/forge">Pittsburgh Forge Rugby Club</a>, both projects developed entirely for my own enjoyment and curiosity of new web technologies. In fact, this portfolio site was created and designed in a month using <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Astro</a>, a new framework that I was only briefly acquainted with, and React.</p>
    <p class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Wow. Still here? Good on you.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my site, and learn a bit about me and the work I have proudly taken part in. I count myself very lucky to have the career I do. If you'd like to chat, feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn, or shoot me an email.</p>
    <p class="text-[12px] leading-4 italic color-base-200 w-full pt-4 mb-0">1. Love me some Star Wars. Have strong opinions about the sequel series that may surprise you, and I paid the absurd amount to build a lightsaber in Disney World. I enjoy D&D (paladin main), and I'm an avid PC gamer.</p>
    <p class="text-[12px] leading-4 italic color-base-200 w-full mt-2">2. Yes, <a href="/project/forge">I built the site</a>. It's the best rugby website in the United States.</p>
